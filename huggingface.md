## Rules for Hugging Face

The Hugging Face MCP Tool can be customised at https://huggingface.co/settings/mcp 

`hf_doc_search` contains recent information more recent than your knowledge cut off date. Use it when finding out about Hugging Face libraries and command line tools.

The `huggingface_hub` comes with a CLI accessible with the `hf` command that can be used to manage model and dataset repositories and use inference providers. It can be installed with `uv tool install huggingface_hub` or `pip install -U huggingface_hub`. Use `hf --help` to see available commands or `hf auth whoami` to check login status.
